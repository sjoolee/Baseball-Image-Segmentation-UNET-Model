# Baseball-Image-Segmentation-UNET-Model

Utilizing a Roboflow dataset of a baseball image dataset: https://universe.roboflow.com/ryan-hogan-vkxi5/baseball-zbcta/dataset/1. It took in the images of the baseball, background and strike zone. ![image](https://github.com/sjoolee/Baseball-Image-Segmentation-UNET-Model/assets/113068909/3c6ee2ba-5ece-4f74-b4b7-87950b6c6a03)

U-NET is a type of machine learning model, more specifically it is a convolutional neural network that is utilized for image segmentation. It is often utilized in biomedical image segmentations and has a modified CNN architecture to work with fewer training images and yield more precise segmentation. While originally intended for biomedical image segmentation, it has now been adapted to do much more, including: remapping images to segmentation masks, upscaling low-resolution to high-resolution images and diffusion models that can transform Guassian noise to newly generated images. In the figure to the left, there are four encoders to the left-most side and there are four decoders on the opposing side. The encoder-decoder structure works as such: the encoder receives the input image then extracts useful features from that image using multiple convolutional layers, then the decoder up-samples the features using transpose convolution and concatenates them through a process called “skip-connection: to get a segmentation mask as the output from the network. The encoder is used to extract features from the input image while the decoder is responsible for up-sampling intermediate features and producing the final output. The encoder and decoder are symmetrical and are connected by paths giving a distinctive U-shape. The encoder has repeated convolutional layers and max-pooling layers that extracts intermediate features which are then up-sampled by a corresponding decoder where saved copies of the encoder’s features are then concatenated onto the decoders features via connecting parts to the final layer which produces the output of a segmentation mask. Skip connections skip some of the layers in the neural network and feed the output of one layer as the input to the next layers. The arrows represent the skip connection process, which helps transfer the selected features directly from the encoder to the decoder, helping the decoder generate a better segmentation mask. Segmentation is when we are learning a mapping from the pixels of an image into the pixels of the segmentation mask. For example, if we had a set of input images with hand-annotated segmentation masks we can train a unit model by passing the images as the inputs to initially guess for an output. The first output may not be very good, but we can still use it to compare it against our ground truth label and use that to adjust the model’s parameters to get a better prediction output. Encoder is made up of a series of 3x3 convolutional layers, at each of the stages after each convolutional layer, the reloot activation function is applied element-wise to each of the features. In between the stages, a 2x2 max-pooling operation down-samples the features. ![image](https://github.com/sjoolee/Baseball-Image-Segmentation-UNET-Model/assets/113068909/e272e47f-c90e-4f0f-91ec-ece3c8a13b26)
